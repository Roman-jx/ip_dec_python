ðŸ¤–IP address definition <--- ?

>An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of >rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

>In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network: they contain location information and make >devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a >way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.

ðŸ¤–What is an IP

>An IP address is a string of numbers separated by periods. IP addresses are expressed as a set of four numbers â€” an example address might be 192.158.1.38. >Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

>IP addresses are not random. They are mathematically produced and allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), a division of the Internet >Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN is a non-profit organization that was established in the United States in 1998 to help maintain >the security of the internet and allow it to be usable by all. Each time anyone registers a domain 
>on the internet, they go through a domain name registrar, who pays a small fee to ICANN to register the domain.
